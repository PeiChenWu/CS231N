# Stanford CS231N Convolutional Neural Network for Visual Recognition
Computer Vision Course Projects include self-implemented image classification mothods/algorithms such as KNN & SVM (Basic), Fully Connected Net, CNN with Batch Norm, RMSProp, Adam, Dropout, etc. Those are different techniques for fixing overfitting/underfitting. At the end, we have also done implemention of RNN and LSTMs for image captioning on MS-COCO, and image geneartion using Pytorch/Tensorflow for Style Transfer and GAN. This is a really amazing experience learning visiaul regnition by taking CS231N at Stanford.

Programming Proficiency & Applications: Python, PyTorch, Tensorflow, Virtual Machine, etc.
